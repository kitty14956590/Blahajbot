invite link = https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=999711705296814220&permissions=51200&scope=bot
A bot made by Pog Cat with the help of mainly Macic, hehe

Mainly for use in the CatBoy lounge but can be used anywhere, you just might not understand a few of the references :3

install the libraries: discord.py, requests

Then at the bottom of the "blahajbot.py" script, put in your discord application token, close the parenthesis and close the brackets, then run!


Enjoy the Blahaj bot script I made
